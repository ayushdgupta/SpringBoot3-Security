# Spring-Security
## Introduction
1. Spring Security is nothing but just bunch of servlet-filters like (UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter).
2. In General when we hit our API then the request is handled by the 'Dispatcher-Servlet' and then Dispacher-servlet will delegate
   the request to the corresponding controller so **No Authentication No Authorization** here i.e. anyone can use any of our API
   component w/o any restrictions.
3. So if we want to apply security in our API then we can use Spring-security by adding following dependency in our build.gradle -
```groovy
implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security'
```
4. So by adding above dependency Spring will automatically configure few Components into our service.
   1. Default AuthenticationManager
   2. Default AuthenticationProvider
   3. Default LoginPage
5. For the default security the userName will be 'user' and the password will come in logs of application.
6. We can change the Default UserName and Password in following ways -
   ### 1. Application.yaml
   1. In aoolication.yaml file we can provide following config to change the default credes -
   ```yaml
    spring:
      security:
        user:
          name: ${userName:ayush}
          password: ${password:guptaji}
    ```
    2. But from here we can define only one user and even this approach is recommended only for testing not for 
       production ready code because we can't expose any creds in our code so that anyone will come and see
       them, although we are providing the values in environment variables but still not recommended.
   ### 2. InMemory User
   1. For login into our ecosystem to access our API's we create some users into our code itself by using
      '**UserDetailsService**' interface.
   2. So for that we need to create one bean into our configuration class for e.g. -
   ```
     @Bean
     public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() 
     {
        UserDetails user1 = User.withUsername(user1Name)
                              .password(passwordEncoder().encode(user1Pass))
                              .roles(user1Role)
                              .build();

        UserDetails user2 = User.withUsername(user2Name)
                        .password(passwordEncoder().encode(user2Pass))
                        .roles(user2Role)
                        .build();

        UserDetails user3 = User.withUsername(user3Name)
                        .password(passwordEncoder().encode(user3Pass))
                        .roles(user3Role)
                        .build();

        InMemoryUserDetailsManager inMemoryUserDetailsManager = new InMemoryUserDetailsManager();
        inMemoryUserDetailsManager.createUser(user1);
        inMemoryUserDetailsManager.createUser(user2);
        inMemoryUserDetailsManager.createUser(user3);

        return inMemoryUserDetailsManager;
     }
   
     @Bean
     public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() 
     {
       return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
     }
   ```
   3. So here if you see we configured three user so now the application.yaml user creds will not work
      only above three users will work for login purpose.
   4. We can annotate our configuration class with '**@EnableWebSecurity**' to switch off the default web 
      application security configuration completely but this does not disable the authentication manager 
      configuration or Actuatorâ€™s security. but again this is Optional according to my knowledge bcz I 
      implemented my code w/o this annotation and it works absolutely fine but in documentation they were
      using that annotation.
   5. Here passwordEncoder() is a bean which will encrypt our password using '**BCryptPasswordEncoder()**'
      provided by the spring boot. We are not saving password directly into our memory.
   6. But again here if we see carefully then we can notice that we again expose some creds into our code, so this
      is again not advisable just use for testing purpose.
   ### 3. DB User
   1. Here instead of creating user creds into our code, we will fetch the creds directly from DB and authenticate
      them.
   2. For that like we have '**InMemoryUserDetailsManager**' class that implements 'UserDetailsService' interface
      for InMemory user we need to create one class which will implement 'UserDetailsService' interface and
      override the method '**loadUserByUsername(String username)**' which will fetch the userDetails from DB based
      on the userName provided by the endUser from login page.
   3. In our code '**UserSecurityInfoUserDetailsService**' class is doing that work for us.
   4. so after fetching the userDetails from DB we need to send it but the return type of method 
      'loadUserByUsername(String username)' is '**UserDetails**' and 'UserDetails' is an interface which provides
      'userName', 'password', 'roles or authorities' etc. to the authentication provider to authenticate the user.
   5. So we need to create another class which will implement 'UserDetails' interface and we need to convert our
      object (contains userInfo. fetched from DB) type into that class.
   6. In our case '**UserSecurityInfoUserDetailsConverter**' is doing this.
